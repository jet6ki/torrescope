Hey! These are all the prompts I used to help build this project. I'm learning full-stack dev and wanted to document how AI helped me figure things out.

## Getting Started 

### Setting up the project
Tool: GitHub Copilot Chat
Model: GPT-4
```
Hey! I want to make a cool Next.js app that shows Torre.ai user data with charts and stuff. I'm pretty new to this - what's a good way to structure everything so it doesn't become a mess later?
```

### Torre API stuff
Tool: ChatGPT
Model: GPT-4
```
I'm trying to use the Torre.ai API but kinda lost. Can you:
1. Show me which endpoints I actually need?
2. Explain what the data looks like when it comes back?
3. Tell me what usually goes wrong so I can fix it?
```

## Building the Cool Parts 

### Making the radar chart
Tool: GitHub Copilot
Model: GPT-4
```
Need help making a radar chart with Recharts to show skills. Never done this before!
- How do I format the data?
- How do I make it work with different numbers of skills?
- Can we make it interactive?
```

### Search bar that actually works
Tool: ChatGPT
Model: GPT-4
```
Help me make a search bar that:
- Doesn't spam the API (heard about debouncing?)
- Shows loading spinner
- Handles errors nicely
```

## Making It Look Good 

### Dark/light mode
Tool: Cursor
Model: Gemini-1.0-flash
```
Want to add dark mode! How do I:
- Set up the theme switcher
- Make it remember user's choice
- Make sure everything looks good in both modes
```

## Fixing Stuff 

### When things break
Tool: GitHub Copilot
Model: GPT-4
```
Getting some API errors. How should I:
- Show nice error messages to users
- Handle different types of errors
- Make sure the app doesn't crash
```

## Deployment 

### Docker help
Tool: GitHub Copilot Chat
Model: GPT-4
```
Never used Docker before! Can you explain:
- How to make a basic Dockerfile for Next.js
- What commands I need to run
- How to make sure it works on production
```

## Stuff I Read 
- Next.js docs (the new app router is confusing!)
- Torre API docs
- Recharts examples (these helped a lot)
- Some Medium articles about radar charts

Note: I used AI to learn and understand stuff, not just copy-paste. Each time I got stuck, I tried to understand why things worked the way they did. Still learning but getting there!
